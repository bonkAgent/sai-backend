# 🕶️ JAMES BONK - License to DeFi  
### *“Built for speed, precision, and a touch of swagger.”*

---

## 🧩 Overview  
James Bonk is an AI-powered DeFi agent designed to simplify Solana trading and analytics into a single, conversational console.  
It blends meme culture, spy-themed storytelling, and serious execution power - turning complex DeFi actions into clean natural-language commands.

Built with Node.js + TypeScript, the system is optimized for scalability, low latency, and modular expansion, making it ready for production-grade integrations across the Solana ecosystem.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 🎯 Mission Console (Main Chat Interface)
Interact with BONK like you would with an agent.  
Execute DeFi actions directly through natural-language prompts:
- Swap or transfer tokens  
- Add / remove liquidity  
- Stake or lend assets  
- Launch new tokens via integrated launchpads  
- Run token analyses, create alerts, or trigger conditional missions  

---

### 🧠 Operation Intel Scan
Every token becomes a dossier. BONK compiles:
- Price & volume dynamics
- Holder distribution & loyalty
- Security & insider risk
- Social sentiment pulse
Result -> a clear mission report with actionable intel.

---

### ⚙️ Mission Triggers (Autonomous Ops)
Define automated orders and conditions:
- *“If price ↑ 50% -> sell 100%”*  
- *“At $0.005 -> exit 50%”*  
- *“In 2h -> add liquidity”*  
The console executes instantly once triggers are met.  
Your agent never sleeps.

The BONK architecture follows a mission-pipeline model:  
User Request -> Parser -> Protocol Modules -> Aggregator -> Intel Output
